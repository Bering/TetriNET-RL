# TetriNET-RL
Yet another clone of TetriNET, the 1997 Tetris game by St0rmCat, written in Unity

## Status
Alpha. Not playable yet. Ugly main menu. Working on Solo mode. Solo backend mostly done. Just got random tetrominoes spawning.

## Features
* Cross-platform (Android. WebGL, Linux, Mac, Windows, maybe more)
* Solo, Join or Host (no dedicated server yet, but I'd really like to make a dedicated Linux server)
* Compatible with the original themes

## TODO
* Start with SOLO mode
* Figure out the controls for Android
* HOST menu (show your public IP, HOST button)
* JOIN menu (IP Address input field and JOIN button
* Lobby (Players list, chat, Start button)
* Learn the protocol (Or maybe just drop legacy servers support.)
* Make the server code
* Figure out a clever way to invite friends (SMS? Email? Twitter? Unity Matchmaking? Photon Library?)
* Options menu (TetriFast, TetriNET2 blocks, Mixers volumes, whatever else?)
* voice chat?

## FAQ

### Is it ready yet?
Nope!

### When will this be ready?
Never! Now go away and stop pestering me :-P

### What's the RL in the name?
It stands for RingLogic, the name of my (fake) company. Or for ReLoaded :-)
