# TetriNET-RL
Yet another clone of TetriNET, the 1997 Tetris game by St0rmcat, written in Unity

## Status
Barely getting started!

## Features
* Cross-platform (Android. WebGL, Linux, Mac, Windows, maybe more)
* Join or Host (no dedicated server yet, but I'd really like to make a dedicated Linux server)

## TODO
* Check out the Unity Services for matchmaking and NAT-traversal
* Decide: text chat?
* Decide: voice chat?
