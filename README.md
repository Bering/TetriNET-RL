# TetriNET-RL
Yet another clone of TetriNET, the 1997 Tetris game by St0rmCat, written in Unity

## Status
Alpha. Not playable. Ugly main menu that scales badly (very very badly). Solo mode only shows random blocks falling without interaction.

## Features
* Cross-platform (Android. WebGL, Linux, Mac, Windows, maybe more)
* Solo, Join or Host (no dedicated server yet, but I'd really like to make a dedicated Linux server)
* Compatible with the original themes

## TODO
* Main menu (SOLO, IP Address edit field and JOIN button, HOST button, Toggle Sound, Toggle Music)
* Make the single-player mode (no special blocks)
* Figure out the controls for Android
* Learn the protocol (there are many open source servers out there)
* Make the server code
* Check out the Unity Services for matchmaking and NAT-traversal
* Figure out a clever way to invite friends (SMS? Email? Twitter? Unity Matchmaking? Photon Lobby?)
* Decide: text chat?
* Decide: voice chat?

## FAQ

### Is it ready yet?
Nope!

### When will this be ready?
Never! Now go away and stop pestering me :-P

### What's the RL in the name?
It stands for RingLogic, the name of my (fake) company
